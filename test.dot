in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular \
fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. \
The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound \
together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track \
in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective \
tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are \
continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion \
of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent \
to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the \
cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein \
products.",

to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone, and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g., frontals, \
parietals, interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, \
which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, \
including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A \
reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance, reduced \
ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously, but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display \
normal ossification at a later developmental stage. The HPO will therefore treat poor, reduced, and decreased officiation as synonymous, \

the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe \
loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial \

early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric \
populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization \
of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including \
subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word \
cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing \
and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard \
these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation.",

which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (\
type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic \
edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when \
it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.",
